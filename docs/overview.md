# Overview of PowerShell in Azure Cloud Shell (Private Preview)

[Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview) is an interactive, browser-accessible shell for managing Azure resources.
Cloud Shell enables access to a browser-based command-line experience built with Azure management tasks in mind.
Leverage Cloud Shell to work untethered from a local machine in a way only the cloud can provide.

## Concepts

- Cloud Shell runs on a temporary machine provided on a per-session, per-user basis
- Cloud Shell times out after 20 minutes without interactive activity
- Cloud Shell can only be accessed with a file share attached
- Cloud Shell is assigned one machine per user account
- Permissions are set as a Windows administrator user

## Features & Tools

The PowerShell experience in Azure Cloud Shell will provide the same benefits as the [Bash shell experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/features), such as:

- Get **authenticated shell access** to Azure **from virtually anywhere**.

- **Persist your files across sessions** in attached Azure File storage.
    - Cloud Shell environment are temporary and as a result require an Azure file share to be mounted to persist your $Home directory.
    On first launch Cloud Shell prompts to create a resource group, storage account, and file share on your behalf.
    This is a one-time step and will be automatically attached for all sessions.
